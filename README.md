# Caregiver

The Android SDK is necessary to build the app. We recommend opening the root "Caregiver" folder in Android Studio 2.1.1 in order to maintain consistent build settings. Additionally, you *must* be using JDK 1.7.x for the project SDK in order for the backend to function properly.

The project has been tested extensively and is guaranteed to build if you follow the instructions above. We cannot guarantee results if any deviations are made.
